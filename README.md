</p>

This repository contains the source code for the `hungryish` web app- it will tell if your image has a *hot dog* or *not*! The inspiration for the project was <a href="https://www.hbo.com/silicon-valley" target="_blank">Jian-Yang from the popular HBO Series Silicon Valley</a>. This project was made possible by many open-sourced libraries and frameworks.
