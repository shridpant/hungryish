<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

This repository contains the source code for the `hungryish` web app- it will tell if your image has a "hot dog" or "not"! The inspiration for the project was <a href="https://www.hbo.com/silicon-valley" target="_blank">Jian-Yang from the popular HBO Series Silicon Valley</a>. This project was made possible by many open-sourced libraries and frameworks.

### Built With

The web app was built completely with Flask, Tensorflow, Jupyter Notebook, Jinja2 and HTML. See `Acknowledgements` for more info.

### Execution

To execute, simply:
  1. Clone this repository with `git clone https://github.com/shridpant/hungryish`. Ensure you have tensorflow and Flask installed.
  2. Execute with `python app.py`.
  3. Open the address from the terminal on your browser. Upload the image and get your results!
