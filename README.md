</p>

This repository contains the source code for the `hungryish` web app- it will tell if your image has a *hot dog* or *not*! The inspiration for the project was <a href="https://www.hbo.com/silicon-valley" target="_blank">Jian-Yang from the popular HBO Series Silicon Valley</a>. This project was made possible by many open-sourced libraries and frameworks.

### Technologies

`Hungryish` was built written in Python 3.x employing Flask and Tensorflow. The front-end is simply HTML and CSS. See `Acknowledgements` for more info.

  1. Clone this repository with `git clone https://github.com/shridpant/hungryish`. 
  2. Navigate to the root folder of the project and execute `pip install -r requirements.txt` to install all dependencies.
  3. Execute with `python app.py`.
  4. Open the address from the terminal on your browser. Upload the image and get your results!
