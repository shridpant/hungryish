<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

This repository contains the source code for the `hungryish` web app- it will tell if your image has a "hot dog" or "not"! The inspiration for the project was <a href="https://www.hbo.com/silicon-valley" target="_blank">Jian-Yang from the popular HBO Series Silicon Valley</a>. This project was made possible by many open-sourced libraries and frameworks.

### Built With

  2. Execute with `python app.py`.
